```elixir
# Phoenix approach: Distribution is the primary concern
defmodule Phoenix.Agent do
  # Agent identity includes cluster awareness from birth

  ]
end
```

**Strengths**:
- ✅ **Architectural Purity**: No local/remote dichotomy in design

    agent = case intelligence_level do
      :reactive -> create_simple_agent(agent_spec)      # 100% reliable
      :proactive -> add_learning_layer(agent_spec)      # Measured improvement
      :adaptive -> add_adaptation_layer(agent_spec)     # Controlled enhancement
