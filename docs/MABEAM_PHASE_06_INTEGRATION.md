# MABEAM Phase 6: Integration and Polish

## Phase Overview

**Goal**: Final integration, documentation, and performance optimization
**Duration**: 2-3 development cycles
**Prerequisites**: Phase 5 complete (Telemetry operational)

## Phase 6 Architecture

```
Final MABEAM Integration
├── Application Integration
├── Performance Optimization
├── Documentation Complete
├── Migration Tools
└── Production Readiness
```

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 6.1: Application Integration
**Duration**: 1 development cycle
**Checkpoint**: MABEAM fully integrated with Foundation.Application

#### Objectives
- Update Foundation.Application supervision tree
- Configuration management
- Service startup coordination
- Health checks integration

#### TDD Approach

**Red Phase**: Test application integration
```elixir
# test/foundation/mabeam/integration_test.exs
defmodule Foundation.MABEAM.IntegrationTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: false
  
  describe "application startup" do
    test "starts all MABEAM services in correct order" do
      # Test that all services start successfully
      assert {:ok, _pid} = Foundation.Application.start(:normal, [])
      
      # Verify MABEAM services are running
      assert Process.whereis(Foundation.MABEAM.Core) != nil
      assert Process.whereis(Foundation.MABEAM.AgentRegistry) != nil
      assert Process.whereis(Foundation.MABEAM.Coordination) != nil
    end
    
    test "handles graceful shutdown" do
      {:ok, _pid} = Foundation.Application.start(:normal, [])
      
      assert :ok = Foundation.Application.stop(:normal)
      
      # Verify clean shutdown
      assert Process.whereis(Foundation.MABEAM.Core) == nil
    end
  end
end
```
