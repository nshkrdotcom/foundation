# Foundation Layer Overview

The Foundation layer provides a robust set of core services for building reliable, distributed applications in Elixir. It is designed to be a comprehensive toolkit for handling common concerns such as configuration, eventing, telemetry, and process management.

## Core Components

The Foundation layer is composed of several key components:

*   **`Foundation`**: The main public API for the Foundation layer. It provides a unified interface for initializing, managing, and interacting with all Foundation services.
*   **`Foundation.Application`**: The main application supervisor. It manages the lifecycle of all Foundation components in a supervised and fault-tolerant manner.
*   **`Foundation.Config`**: A configuration management service that provides a centralized way to manage application configuration.
*   **`Foundation.Events`**: An event management and storage service that provides a reliable way to handle and persist events.
*   **`Foundation.Telemetry`**: A telemetry and metrics collection service that provides a standardized way to collect and report telemetry data.
*   **`Foundation.ProcessRegistry`**: A centralized process registry that provides a way to register and discover processes in a distributed environment.
*   **`Foundation.ServiceRegistry`**: A high-level service registration and discovery API that provides a clean interface for managing services.
*   **`Foundation.Error` and `Foundation.ErrorContext`**: A comprehensive error handling and context system that provides a structured way to manage and report errors.
*   **`Foundation.Infrastructure`**: A collection of infrastructure services, including circuit breakers, connection managers, and rate limiters.
*   **`Foundation.Coordination`**: A set of coordination primitives for building distributed systems, including distributed locks, consensus, barriers, and leader election.

## MABEAM

MABEAM (Multi-Agent BEAM) is a feature of the Foundation layer that provides a framework for building multi-agent systems. It includes components for agent management, communication, coordination, and more. MABEAM is designed to be a higher-level abstraction on top of the core Foundation services.

## Design Philosophy

The Foundation layer is designed with the following principles in mind:

*   **Reliability**: The Foundation layer is designed to be highly reliable and fault-tolerant. It uses supervision trees and other OTP principles to ensure that services are automatically restarted in the event of a failure.
*   **Scalability**: The Foundation layer is designed to be scalable and performant. It uses techniques such as connection pooling and rate limiting to ensure that services can handle a large number of requests.
*   **Extensibility**: The Foundation layer is designed to be extensible. It provides a set of core services that can be easily extended with custom functionality.
*   **Usability**: The Foundation layer is designed to be easy to use. It provides a clean and well-documented API that makes it easy to get started.
