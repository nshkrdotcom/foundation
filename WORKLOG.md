# Foundation Fresh Start - Work Log

**APPEND ONLY - NO EDITS**

---

## 2025-06-28 16:45 UTC - Project Initiated
- Created PLAN.md with fresh start implementation strategy
- Analyzed dependency elimination vs complete rewrite tradeoffs
- Decision: Fresh start following PLAN_0001.md architecture
- Preserving old code as reference in foundation_old/ and mabeam_old/

## 2025-06-28 16:46 UTC - Phase 1.1 Starting
- Beginning Foundation.Application clean implementation
- Target: Zero MABEAM knowledge, clean supervision tree
- Referencing old Foundation.Application for service patterns only

## 2025-06-28 16:50 UTC - Phase 1.1 Complete
- Created clean Foundation.Application with zero MABEAM knowledge
- Clean supervision tree: infrastructure → foundation_services → coordination → application
- Agent-aware service definitions without application coupling
- Enhanced health monitoring and graceful shutdown
- 320+ lines of clean, well-documented supervisor code

## 2025-06-28 17:00 UTC - Phase 1.2 Complete  
- Created enhanced ProcessRegistry with agent-aware capabilities
- Distribution-ready process identification: {namespace, node, id}
- Rich agent metadata: capabilities, health, resources, coordination_variables
- Agent-specific lookup functions: by_capability, by_type, by_health
- ETS-based indexes for fast agent queries
- Future Horde integration points for clustering
- Process monitoring and automatic cleanup
- 600+ lines of comprehensive registry implementation

## 2025-06-28 17:10 UTC - Phase 1.3 Complete
- Created comprehensive Coordination Primitives for multi-agent systems
- Consensus mechanisms with quorum/unanimous voting support
- Barrier synchronization for coordinated agent execution  
- Distributed locks with deadlock prevention
- Leader election using agent health and capabilities
- All primitives agent-aware and distribution-ready
- Participant monitoring and failure handling
- 600+ lines of robust coordination infrastructure

## 2025-06-28 17:15 UTC - PHASE1_CONTINUATION.md Created
- Comprehensive continuation guide for new contexts
- TDD approach: 1(impl) → 3(test) → 4(missing services) → 3(test) cycle
- References all required docs for context bootstrapping
- Detailed phase breakdown with success criteria
- Ready for Phase 1.4.1: Infrastructure Services implementation
- Self-contained instructions for context handoff

## 2025-06-28 17:20 UTC - PHASE1_CONTINUATION.md Updated
- Added critical context about foundation_old/ and mabeam_old/ preservation
- Included WORKLOG.md instructions (APPEND ONLY format)
- Added what we actually implemented with timestamps and file details
- Clarified fresh start approach vs dependency cleanup
- Ready for proper context handoff to new sessions
