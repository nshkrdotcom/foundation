Of course. You've laid out a powerful and forward-thinking vision. The key is to translate that vision into a concrete technical design that respects the architectural principles we've established: maximum reusability in `foundation`, no unnecessary wrappers, and a clear path from simple optimization to recursive meta-optimization.

This document expands on the provided PRD and TDD, fleshing out the technical details to create a clear blueprint for implementation.

## Enhanced Technical Design: Foundation as a Universal Agent OS

### 1. Executive Summary & Architectural Principles

This design solidifies the vision of **Foundation as a generic, domain-agnostic "Agent Operating System" for the BEAM.** It provides two distinct but related layers of abstraction:

1.  **`Foundation.MABEAM`**: The low-level "kernel" for multi-agent primitives. It manages processes, state, and coordination via economic models (auctions, markets). It knows *how* to make agents interact but not *why*.
2.  **`Foundation.Agents`**: A higher-level "standard library" for building goal-oriented agents. It sits atop MABEAM and provides a generic framework for planning and execution. It knows *that* an agent has a goal and a plan, but not what those goals are.

**ElixirML** consumes these layers directly, providing the ML-specific domain knowledge to translate a `DSPEx.Program` into a `Foundation.Agents.Agent` and an optimization problem into a `Foundation.Agents.Goal`.

### 2. Detailed Component Specifications

Here we expand upon the PRD and TDD, defining the precise interfaces and internal logic.

#### **Epic 1: `Foundation.MABEAM` Core Enhancements**

##### **Feature 1.1: Universal Variable Orchestrator (`Core`)**

The `Core` module is the central nervous system. Its primary job is to execute coordination functions associated with system-wide variables.

*   **Data Structure (`orchestration_variable`)**:
    ```elixir
    defstruct [
      :id,      # :active_coder_pool, :system_temperature
      :type,    # :resource_allocation, :parameter_tuning
      :agents,  # List of agent_ids this variable affects
      :coordination_fn, # The function to call to enact a change
      # e.g., &Foundation.MABEAM.Coordination.Auction.run_auction/3
      :adaptation_fn,   # (Optional) Function to auto-adjust this variable based on metrics
      :constraints      # e.g., max_agents: 5
    ]
    ```
*   **Key Logic (`coordinate_system/0`)**:
    1.  Iterates through all registered orchestration variables.
    2.  For each variable, it gathers the current context (e.g., system load from Telemetry).
    3.  It calls the variable's `:coordination_fn`, passing in the affected agents and context.
    4.  The result of the `coordination_fn` (e.g., the winner of an auction) is then used to update system state, for example, by directing the `AgentRegistry` to start or stop agents.

##### **Feature 1.2: Advanced Agent Registry**

This is more than a process registry; it's an agent lifecycle manager.

*   **Public Interface (`register_agent/2`)**: It accepts a generic configuration map, making it domain-agnostic.
    ```elixir
    # This is how ElixirML would use it directly
    agent_config = %{
      module: ElixirML.Process.ProgramWorker, # The generic worker that wraps a DSPEx program
      args: [program_module: MyDSPExProgram],
      type: :ml_worker,
      restart_policy: {:permanent, max_restarts: 5, period_seconds: 60},
      capabilities: [:code_generation, :python],
      resource_requirements: %{memory_mb: 512}
    }
    Foundation.MABEAM.AgentRegistry.register_agent(:python_coder_1, agent_config)
    ```
*   **Internal Logic (Health Monitoring)**: It will use `Process.monitor/1` on every agent it starts. On a `{:DOWN, ...}` message, it will consult the agent's `restart_policy` and either restart it, mark it as failed, or give up.

##### **Feature 1.3: Coordination Protocols**

These are pure, algorithmic modules. They take agents and context, and return a result.

*   **Example: `Auction.run_auction/3`**:
    *   **Input**: `run_auction(:cpu_time, [agent1, agent2], auction_type: :english, starting_price: 10)`
    *   **Process**:
        1.  It does *not* know what `:cpu_time` is. It's just an ID.
        2.  It sends messages (e.g., `GenServer.call`) to the PIDs of `agent1` and `agent2`, asking for their bids at the current price. This requires the agents to implement a simple `:handle_bid_request` callback.
        3.  It iteratively increases the price and repeats step 2 until a winner is found.
    *   **Output**: `{:ok, %{winner: :agent2, payment: 50.0, ...}}`

---

#### **Epic 2: `Foundation.Agents` Framework (The New Generic Layer)**

This is the key to enabling meta-optimization. It provides the structure for any kind of goal-oriented agent.

##### **Feature 2.1: The `Agent` Behaviour**

**File: `lib/foundation/agents/agent.ex`**
```elixir
defmodule Foundation.Agents.Agent do
  @moduledoc "A generic behaviour for a goal-oriented, reasoning agent."

  alias Foundation.Agents.{Goal, Plan, Step}

  # An agent receives a high-level goal and must return a plan.
  @callback plan(goal :: Goal.t(), state :: map()) :: {:ok, Plan.t()} | {:error, term()}

  # An agent receives a single step from a plan and must execute it.
  @callback execute_step(step :: Step.t(), state :: map()) :: {:ok, result :: term()} | {:error, term()}

  # An agent declares its capabilities for planner matching.
  @callback get_capabilities() :: [atom()]
end
```

##### **Feature 2.2: The Generic `Planner`**

The Planner is the brain of this layer. It's a deterministic executor, not an AI itself.

**File: `lib/foundation/agents/planner.ex`**
```elixir
defmodule Foundation.Agents.Planner do
  alias Foundation.MABEAM.{AgentRegistry, Coordination}
  alias Foundation.Agents.{Goal, Plan}

  # This is the entry point for meta-optimizers.
  def execute_goal(goal, available_agents_by_capability) do
    # 1. Decompose the goal into a logical plan (this part is simple initially)
    plan = decompose(goal)

    # 2. Find and start the necessary agents using the generic MABEAM API
    required_capabilities = Enum.map(plan.steps, & &1.required_capability)
    agent_assignments = assign_agents(required_capabilities, available_agents_by_capability)
    
    for {step, agent_id} <- agent_assignments do
      # This is a direct call to the generic MABEAM layer
      AgentRegistry.start_agent(agent_id) 
    end

    # 3. Execute the plan
    execute_plan(plan, agent_assignments)
  end

  defp execute_plan(plan, assignments) do
    # This is where the coordination logic happens.
    # It sends `:execute_step` messages to the assigned agents' PIDs,
    # respecting the plan's dependency graph.
    # It might use MABEAM.Coordination.barrier_sync to wait for parallel steps.
  end
end
```

---

#### **Epic 3: `ElixirML` Integration (The Minimal, Essential Bridge)**

As established, this is a **translator**, not a wrapper.

##### **The `agentize` Function**
This is the most critical piece of the bridge.

**File: `lib/elixir_ml/mabeam/integration.ex`**
```elixir
defmodule ElixirML.MABEAM.Integration do
  # This module implements the generic `Foundation.Agents.Agent` behaviour
  # for DSPEx programs.

  defstruct [:program_module, :variable_config]

  @behaviour Foundation.Agents.Agent

  # `plan/2` is simple for a program-as-agent: the plan is a single step.
  @impl Foundation.Agents.Agent
  def plan(goal, state) do
    # Translate the generic goal into specific DSPEx input fields.
    dspex_inputs = translate_goal_to_inputs(goal, state.program_module)
    
    step = %Foundation.Agents.Step{
      id: :execute_program,
      action: :forward,
      params: dspex_inputs,
      required_capability: state.program_module.get_capability() # e.g., :code_generation_python
    }
    
    plan = %Foundation.Agents.Plan{steps: [step]}
    {:ok, plan}
  end

  # `execute_step/2` calls the DSPEx program's `forward` function.
  @impl Foundation.Agents.Agent
  def execute_step(step, state) do
    DSPEx.Program.forward(state.program_module, step.params, config: state.variable_config)
  end
  
  @impl Foundation.Agents.Agent
  def get_capabilities, do: # ...
end
```
When `Foundation.Agents.Planner` tells an "agent" to execute a step, it's actually calling the `execute_step` callback on this bridge module, which in turn runs the `DSPEx.Program`. This is how the generic framework drives the specific ML logic without knowing anything about it.

---

#### **Epic 4: `DSPEx` Universal Optimizer Structure**

The optimizer operates on the `OptimizationTarget` behaviour.

**Example: A Meta-Optimizer `evaluate` implementation**
```elixir
# In DSPEx.AgentTeam.OptimizerTarget

@impl DSPEx.Teleprompter.OptimizationTarget
def evaluate(target, _training_data, metric_fn) do
  # 1. Get the architecture chosen by the optimizer for this run.
  architecture = target.current_architecture
  # e.g., %{coder: PythonCoder, reviewer: StrictReviewer}

  # 2. Build the high-level goal for the generic Foundation.Agents layer.
  goal = %Foundation.Agents.Goal{
    id: :build_feature,
    description: "Implement and review the user login feature.",
    # The Planner will use this to find agents with matching capabilities
    steps: [
      %{id: :coding, capability: :code_generation, input: "feature specs..."},
      %{id: :review, capability: :code_review, depends_on: :coding}
    ]
  }

  # 3. Define the pool of available agents for the planner.
  available_agents = %{
    code_generation: [architecture.coder],
    code_review: [architecture.reviewer]
  }

  # 4. DIRECTLY CALL the generic Foundation.Agents Planner.
  #    This is the "system call" from the ML application to the Agent OS.
  case Foundation.Agents.Planner.execute_goal(goal, available_agents) do
    {:ok, final_result} ->
      # 5. Score the result and return it to the optimizer.
      score = metric_fn.(final_result)
      {:ok, score}
    
    {:error, reason} ->
      {:error, reason}
  end
end
```

This detailed design provides a clear path forward, respecting the architectural principles and enabling the powerful, layered optimization you envisioned. It makes `Foundation` a truly reusable and powerful asset while keeping `ElixirML` and `DSPEx` focused on their core ML competencies.


=== 20250622_1001_gemini.md ===
Excellent. This is a critical and insightful refinement of the architecture. Decoupling the generic `Agents` framework from `Foundation` and treating it as a separate, dependent layer is the correct move. It purifies `Foundation` into a true, reusable BEAM infrastructure library and provides maximum flexibility for `ElixirML` to evolve its agentic capabilities independently.

This new structure perfectly supports your vision of parallel non-agentic and agentic workflows, culminating in powerful meta-optimizers.

Here is the comprehensive architectural plan and revised Foundation PRD that reflects this more sophisticated, layered approach.

---

### Part 1: The New Grand Architecture - Parallel Stacks

This new architecture clearly delineates two primary workflows: a direct, non-agentic path for standard program optimization, and a more advanced agentic path that leverages the new `Agents` layer for meta-optimization.

```

**Workflow Explanation:**

1.  **Non-Agentic Path (Left Side):** This is for standard DSPy functionality. A `Base Optimizer` in `DSPEx` uses `ElixirML`'s core `Variable` and `Schema` systems. To execute a program, it can directly use `Foundation.MABEAM.AgentRegistry` to start a simple process, bypassing the `Agents` layer entirely. This is lean, fast, and efficient for single-program optimization.

2.  **Agentic Path (Right Side):** This is for advanced meta-optimization.
    *   An `Agentic Meta-Optimizer` in `DSPEx` orchestrates the workflow.
    *   It interacts with the `Agentic Bridge` in `ElixirML` to define *what constitutes an agent* (e.g., mapping a `DSPEx.Program` to the `Agent` behaviour) and *what architectural variables to tune*.
    *   The `ElixirML` bridge then uses the new, separate `Agents` module to create high-level goals and plans.
    *   The `Agents` module, in turn, uses the low-level primitives from `Foundation.MABEAM` to execute its plans (e.g., "start 3 worker processes," "run a resource auction").

This parallel design perfectly isolates the complexity. Simple workflows don't pay the overhead of the agentic framework, while complex workflows have a powerful, generic foundation to build upon.

### Part 2: Revised Foundation MABEAM Enhancement PRD

This PRD is now leaner and more focused. The `Foundation.Agents` epic has been removed and will become its own separate project.

**Product Requirements Document**  
**Version 2.0 (Refined Scope)**

#### Executive Summary

This PRD defines the enhancement of **Foundation's MABEAM system to serve as the universal primitive layer for multi-agent coordination on the BEAM.** It provides the low-level, domain-agnostic "kernel" functionalities—process management, state synchronization, and economic coordination—upon which higher-level agent frameworks (like the planned `Agents` module and `ElixirML`) can be built. This enhancement solidifies Foundation's role as a reusable, high-performance infrastructure library for any distributed Elixir application.

#### **Epic 1: Production-Ready MABEAM Primitives (The "Kernel")**

**Objective**: To provide a robust, generic, and performant set of tools for managing and coordinating groups of supervised processes (referred to generically as "agents").

*   **Feature 1.1: Universal Variable Orchestrator (`Core`)**
    *   **Requirement:** Manage system-wide variables that trigger generic coordination functions. The `Core` orchestrator should not have any domain-specific logic.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Can register a variable with a reference to a coordination function (e.g., `&MyCoordination.run/3`).
        *   `coordinate_system/0` successfully invokes these functions, passing the relevant context.
        *   The system is fully observable via `Foundation.Telemetry`.

*   **Feature 1.2: Advanced Process Registry (`AgentRegistry`)**
    *   **Requirement:** Sophisticated lifecycle management for any supervised process, configured via a generic map.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   `register_agent/2` accepts a generic `%{module: ..., args: ..., restart_policy: ...}` config.
        *   Manages starting, stopping, and restarting these processes according to their policy.
        *   Provides health status based on process liveness (`Process.alive?/1`).
        *   Tracks basic resource usage (memory, message queue length) for registered PIDs.

*   **Feature 1.3: Pluggable Coordination Protocols (`Coordination`)**
    *   **Requirement:** A framework for executing domain-agnostic coordination algorithms like auctions and consensus.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   `register_protocol/2` allows adding new coordination algorithms at runtime.
        *   Includes built-in, generic implementations for `Auction` (sealed-bid, English), `Market` (equilibrium finding), and `Consensus` (majority vote).
        *   These protocols communicate with registered processes via a simple, defined message-passing interface (e.g., a `:get_bid` GenServer call), keeping them decoupled.

#### **Epic 2: Distribution and Clustering Primitives**

**Objective**: To enable MABEAM coordination to scale across multiple BEAM nodes.

*   **Feature 2.1: Cluster-Aware Registry & Orchestrator**
    *   **Requirement:** The `AgentRegistry` and `Core` orchestrator must be ableto operate across a distributed BEAM cluster.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Can register and start a process on a remote node.
        *   Can coordinate processes running on different nodes.
        *   Leverages `Horde` or a similar library for distributed process supervision and registry.

*   **Feature 2.2: Generic Process Migration**
    *   **Requirement:** Provide a primitive for migrating a generic process (and its state) from one node to another.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   `MABEAM.migrate_process(pid, destination_node)` successfully moves a GenServer's state.
        *   The migration is stateful and handles temporary network failures.

*   **Feature 2.3: Distributed Variable Primitives**
    *   **Requirement:** Provide primitives for synchronizing a shared value across multiple nodes.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Includes strategies for eventual consistency (gossip) and strong consistency (consensus via Raft/Paxos-lite).
        *   Provides basic conflict resolution like `last_write_wins`.

#### **OUT OF SCOPE for this PRD:**

*   **The `Agents` Framework:** The higher-level concepts of `Goal`, `Plan`, and the `Agent` behaviour are **not** part of Foundation. This will be a separate module/library that *depends on* this enhanced Foundation.MABEAM.
*   **ML-Specific Logic:** All translation from `DSPEx.Program` to a generic process config, and from `ElixirML.Variable` to an orchestration plan, resides exclusively in `ElixirML`.

---

### Part 3: Revised Foundation MABEAM Technical Design

The technical design is now simplified and purified, removing all high-level agentic concepts.

*   **`Foundation.MABEAM.AgentRegistry`:**
    *   **`register_agent(id, config)`**: The `config` map is now strictly generic. It contains `:module`, `:args`, `:restart_policy`, and optional `:capabilities` (a simple list of atoms like `:database_access` or `:gpu_enabled` that are domain-agnostic).
    *   **Supervision:** Will use a `DynamicSupervisor` to start children based on the provided `:module` and `:args`. The agent module itself must conform to a standard child spec (e.g., implement `start_link/1`).

*   **`Foundation.MABEAM.Coordination`:**
    *   **Interaction Model:** When a coordination protocol needs input from a process (e.g., an auction needs a bid), it will use a standardized `GenServer.call(pid, {:mabeam_coordination_request, request})`.
    *   **Example Request:** `{:mabeam_coordination_request, %{protocol: :auction, type: :get_bid, current_price: 50.0}}`.
    *   **Responsibility:** It is the responsibility of the *agent process module* (e.g., the `ElixirML.Process.ProgramWorker`) to implement the `handle_call` for this message, not Foundation. This keeps Foundation decoupled.

*   **API Purity:** All function names and types will be reviewed to remove high-level agentic language. For instance, functions related to the `Agents` framework (`handle_goal`, `plan`) will not exist anywhere in `Foundation`.

### Part 4: Revised Implementation Roadmap

The roadmap is now more focused on delivering the core primitives first.

*   **Phase 1: Core MABEAM Primitives (Weeks 1-4)**
    *   **Goal:** Implement a fully functional, single-node `Core`, `AgentRegistry`, and `Types`.
    *   **Deliverables:** Robust process lifecycle management and basic telemetry.

*   **Phase 2: Coordination Protocols (Weeks 5-8)**
    *   **Goal:** Implement the generic `Coordination` engine and the `Auction`, `Market`, and `Consensus` modules.
    *   **Deliverables:** A set of pluggable, domain-agnostic algorithms for resource allocation and agreement. The standard message-passing interface (`:mabeam_coordination_request`) will be finalized.

*   **Phase 3: Distribution & Clustering (Weeks 9-12)**
    *   **Goal:** Make the primitives work across a BEAM cluster.
    *   **Deliverables:** Distributed `AgentRegistry`, process migration, and basic distributed variable synchronization.

*   **Phase 4: Hardening & Production Readiness (Weeks 13-16)**
    *   **Goal:** Performance optimization, comprehensive documentation, and developer tools.
    *   **Deliverables:** Benchmarks, deployment guides, and observability dashboards.

This refined plan creates a powerful, reusable `Foundation.MABEAM` layer that perfectly serves as the "kernel" for the forthcoming `Agents` module and the broader `ElixirML`/`DSPEx` ecosystem, without baking in any domain-specific logic.

## Real-World Usage Examples

### Example 1: Zero-Config Development
```elixir
# mix.exs - Just add Foundation
{:foundation, "~> 2.0"}

# lib/my_app/application.ex
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      # Foundation automatically handles clustering in development
      {Foundation, []},
      
      # Your services work distributed automatically
      MyApp.UserService,
      MyApp.OrderService,
      MyApp.Web.Endpoint
    ]
    
    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
end

# Start multiple nodes for development
# iex --name dev1@localhost -S mix
# iex --name dev2@localhost -S mix
# Foundation automatically discovers and connects them via mdns_lite
```

### Example 2: One-Line Production
```elixir
# config/prod.exs
config :foundation,
  cluster: :kubernetes  # That's it!

# Foundation automatically:
# - Configures libcluster with Kubernetes strategy
# - Sets up Horde for distributed processes
# - Enables Phoenix.PubSub for messaging
# - Configures Nebulex for distributed caching
# - Provides health checks and monitoring
```

### Example 3: Advanced Multi-Service Architecture
```elixir
# config/prod.exs
config :foundation,
  profile: :enterprise,
  clusters: %{
    # Web tier
    web: [
      strategy: {Cluster.Strategy.Kubernetes, [
        mode: :hostname,
        kubernetes_selector: "tier=web"
      ]},
      services: [:web_servers, :api_gateways],
      messaging: [:user_events, :api_requests]
    ],
    
    # Processing tier  
    processing: [
      strategy: {Cluster.Strategy.Kubernetes, [
        kubernetes_selector: "tier=processing"
      ]},
      services: [:background_jobs, :data_processors],
      messaging: [:job_queue, :data_events]
    ],
    
    # AI tier
    ai: [
      strategy: {Cluster.Strategy.Consul, [
        service_name: "ai-cluster"
      ]},
      services: [:ai_workers, :model_cache],
      messaging: [:inference_requests, :model_updates]
    ]
  }

# lib/my_app/user_service.ex
defmodule MyApp.UserService do
  use GenServer
  
  def start_link(opts) do
    # Foundation makes this automatically distributed
    Foundation.ProcessManager.start_distributed_process(
      __MODULE__, 
      opts,
      strategy: :singleton,  # One instance across entire cluster
      cluster: :web
    )
  end
  
  def process_user(user_id) do
    # Foundation handles service discovery and routing
    Foundation.Messaging.send_message(
      {:service, :user_service},
      {:process_user, user_id}
    )
  end
end
```

### Example 4: ElixirScope Integration
```elixir
# Distributed debugging across Foundation cluster
defmodule MyApp.DebuggingExample do
  def debug_distributed_request(request_id) do
    # ElixirScope + Foundation = distributed debugging magic
    Foundation.Context.with_context(%{
      request_id: request_id,
      debug_session: ElixirScope.start_debug_session()
    }) do
      
      # Process request across multiple services/nodes
      user = Foundation.call_service(:user_service, {:get_user, user_id})
      order = Foundation.call_service(:order_service, {:create_order, user, items})
      
      # ElixirScope automatically traces across all nodes
      ElixirScope.complete_trace(request_id)
    end
  end
end
```

### Example 5: DSPEx Distributed Optimization
```elixir
# Leverage Foundation for distributed AI optimization
defmodule MyApp.AIOptimization do
  def optimize_model_across_cluster() do
    # DSPEx + Foundation = distributed AI optimization
    program = create_base_program()
    dataset = load_training_dataset()
    metric = &accuracy_metric/2
    
    # Foundation automatically distributes across AI cluster
    optimized_program = Foundation.AI.distribute_optimization(
      DSPEx.BootstrapFewShot,
      program,
      dataset, 
      metric,
      cluster: :ai,
      max_workers: Foundation.Cluster.node_count(:ai) * 4
    )
    
    # Result is automatically cached across cluster
    Foundation.Cache.put("optimized_model_v#{version()}", optimized_program)
    
    optimized_program
  end
end
```

      ]
    ]
  ]

# After: Foundation orchestration
config :foundation,
  cluster: :kubernetes  # Foundation handles the rest
  
# Migration helper
Foundation.Migration.from_libcluster(existing_libcluster_config)
```

### From Swarm
```elixir
# Before: Swarm registration
Swarm.register_name(:my_process, MyProcess, :start_link, [args])

# After: Foundation process management

  MyProcess,
  args,
  name: :my_process,
  strategy: :singleton
)

# Migration helper
Foundation.Migration.from_swarm(existing_swarm_processes)
```

**Deliverables**:
```elixir
# lib/foundation/mabeam/telemetry.ex
defmodule Foundation.MABEAM.Telemetry do
  @moduledoc """
  MABEAM telemetry that extends Foundation.Telemetry with 
  agent-specific metrics and coordination analytics.
  """
  
  def record_coordination_event(event_type, agents, result, duration) do
    # Use Foundation's telemetry infrastructure
    Foundation.Telemetry.emit(
      [:mabeam, :coordination, event_type],
      %{
        agent_count: length(agents),
        result: result,
        duration: duration
      },
      %{
        coordination_type: event_type,
        cluster_size: Foundation.Cluster.size(),
        node: Node.self()
      }
    )
  end
end

# Enhanced Foundation.Channels with coordination capabilities
defmodule Foundation.Channels do
  # Existing message routing...
  
  # NEW: Coordination-specific message routing
  def coordinate_consensus(agents, proposal, opts \\ []) do
    broadcast(:coordination, {:consensus_start, proposal})
    collect_responses(agents, :consensus_vote, opts)
  end
  
  def run_auction(auction_spec, bidders, opts \\ []) do
    broadcast(:coordination, {:auction_start, auction_spec})
    collect_bids(bidders, auction_spec, opts)
  end
end
```

    # Leverage Foundation's distributed tracing
    Foundation.Channels.broadcast(:tracing, {:trace_coordination, protocol_id})
  end
  
  def analyze_agent_decisions(agent_id, decision_context) do
    # Trace agent decision-making process
    agent_state = Foundation.MABEAM.AgentRegistry.get_agent_state(agent_id)
    coordination_history = Foundation.MABEAM.Telemetry.get_coordination_history(agent_id)
    
    correlate_decisions_with_coordination(agent_state, coordination_history, decision_context)
  end
end
```

      count: Foundation.Cluster.size(),
      capabilities: [:dsp_optimization, :auction_bidding]
    )
    
    # Coordinate optimization using auction mechanism
    optimization_results = Foundation.MABEAM.Coordination.run_auction(
      %{
        type: :optimization_auction,
        objective: metric,
        constraints: %{max_time: 300, max_memory: 2048}
      },
      agents
    )
