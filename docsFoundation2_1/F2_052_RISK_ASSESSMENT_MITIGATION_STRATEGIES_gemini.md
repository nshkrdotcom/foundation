# Foundation 2.0: Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategies

**Purpose**: To proactively identify and plan for the potential downsides and failure modes of our architectural choices.

| Risk Category | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Horde** | **Eventual Consistency Race Conditions**: Developer calls `start_singleton` and immediately tries to `lookup_singleton` from another node before the registry has synced. | **High** | Medium | 1.  **Documentation**: Clearly document the "Lifecycle of a Distributed Process" and the sync delay. <br> 2.  **Facade Helper**: Add an optional `wait_for_sync: true` argument to `start_singleton` that polls the registry until the process appears, with a timeout. <br> 3.  **Encourage Event-Driven Patterns**: Guide users to react to `:service_up` events on the PubSub channel rather than polling the registry. |
| **libcluster** | **Split-Brain Clusters**: A network partition causes two or more independent clusters to form, leading to duplicate singletons and inconsistent state. | Medium | **High** | 1.  **Quorum Configuration**: For strategies that support it (like Gossip), Foundation's "Apprentice Mode" will automatically configure a quorum based on expected node count. `quorum_size = div(expected_nodes, 2) + 1`. <br> 2.  **HealthMonitor Detection**: The `HealthMonitor` will detect when `Node.list()` is smaller than the configured quorum and raise a critical alert. <br> 3.  **Static Seeds**: For production setups, recommend using a static list of seed nodes (e.g., Kubernetes headless service DNS) in addition to dynamic discovery to anchor the cluster. |
| **Leaky Abstraction** | **The Abstraction is *too* Leaky / Confusing**: Developers don't understand when to use the facade vs. the raw tool, leading to inconsistent or incorrect usage. | Medium | Medium | 1.  **Crystal-Clear Documentation**: The `IMPL_PATTS_BEST_PRACTICES.md` is key. Every facade function docstring must explain *what it does*, *what it wraps*, and *when to bypass it*. <br> 2.  **Excellent Logging**: As shown in the patterns, the facades will log exactly which underlying functions they are calling with which arguments at the `DEBUG` level. This makes tracing behavior trivial. <br> 3.  **Credo Checks**: We can write custom Credo checks that suggest using a `Foundation` facade when raw tool usage is detected for a common pattern. |
| **Performance** | **Facade Overhead**: The convenience wrappers add unacceptable latency or CPU overhead compared to direct tool usage. | Low | Low | 1.  **Stateless Facades**: Our facades are designed to be stateless modules, not `GenServer`s, minimizing per-call overhead. <br> 2.  **Benchmarking**: The `Testing Strategy` includes performance benchmarks that will explicitly compare facade calls vs. direct calls to ensure overhead is negligible (<5%). |
| **Configuration** | **Auto-Detection Failure**: The "Mortal Mode" auto-detection picks the wrong strategy for a given environment (e.g., chooses Gossip in a K8s environment where the API is firewalled). | Medium | High | 1.  **Verbose Logging**: The `ClusterConfig` module will log every step of its detection logic (`Detected K8s env vars`, `mdns_lite not found`, `Falling back to Gossip`). <br> 2.  **Clear Override Path**: Documentation will prominently feature the "Apprentice Mode" (`config :foundation, cluster: :kubernetes`) as the one-line fix for any auto-detection failure. |
