defmodule Foundation.ProcessRegistry.Backend.Horde do
  @moduledoc """
  Placeholder Horde backend for Foundation.ProcessRegistry.

  This module provides the interface and basic structure for a future
  distributed registry implementation using Horde. Currently implements
  basic functionality with plans for full distribution capabilities.

  When libcluster and horde dependencies are added, this module will provide:
  - Distributed process registration across BEAM clusters  
  - Automatic failover and process migration
  - Consistent hashing for optimal distribution
  - CRDT-based conflict resolution

  ## Future Distribution Features

  - Multi-node process registry with automatic sync
  - Process migration during node failures
  - Distributed metadata indexing 
  - Cross-cluster service discovery
  - Partition tolerance with eventual consistency

  ## Current Implementation

  For now, this backend delegates to the ETS backend but maintains
  the API structure needed for future Horde integration.
