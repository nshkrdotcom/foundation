# SLEEP FUNCTIONS REMOVAL REPORT

## CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED
Found **16 Process.sleep() calls** in production lib/ code that need immediate removal and proper concurrent implementation.

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
The sleep functions were introduced as LAZY HACKS instead of proper:
- Process synchronization using GenServer calls/casts
- OTP supervision and process linking
- Message passing with receive blocks
- Timer-based scheduling with Process.send_after
- Proper async/await patterns

## SLEEP FUNCTIONS TO FIX (ONE AT A TIME)

### 1. /lib/foundation/service_registry.ex:484
**Current Code:**
```elixir
Process.sleep(10)
```
**Problem:** Blocking wait in service lifecycle management
**Fix Strategy:** Use GenServer synchronization with proper state management
**Test to Run:** `mix test test/foundation/service_registry_test.exs`

### 2. /lib/foundation/utils.ex:582
**Current Code:**
```elixir
Process.sleep(delay)
```
**Problem:** Blocking delay in retry mechanism
**Fix Strategy:** Use Process.send_after with receive block for non-blocking delays
**Test to Run:** `mix test test/foundation/utils_test.exs`

### 3. /lib/foundation/process_registry.ex:769
**Current Code:**
```elixir
Process.sleep(50)
```
**Problem:** Race condition hack in process cleanup
**Fix Strategy:** Use proper process monitoring with Process.monitor and receive
**Test to Run:** `mix test test/foundation/process_registry_test.exs`

### 4. /lib/foundation/process_registry.ex:780
**Current Code:**
```elixir
Process.sleep(200)
```
**Problem:** Arbitrary wait for process termination
**Fix Strategy:** Use Process.exit with trap_exit and proper shutdown handling
**Test to Run:** `mix test test/foundation/process_registry_test.exs`

### 5. /lib/foundation/mabeam/load_balancer.ex:292
**Current Code:**
```elixir
:test_mode_agent -> spawn(fn -> Process.sleep(:infinity) end)
```
**Problem:** Infinite sleep for test agents
**Fix Strategy:** Use GenServer with proper state management and test hooks
**Test to Run:** `mix test test/foundation/mabeam/load_balancer_test.exs`

### 6. /lib/foundation/infrastructure/pool_workers/http_worker.ex:313
**Current Code:**
```elixir
Process.sleep(delay_ms)
```
**Problem:** Blocking HTTP retry delays
**Fix Strategy:** Use :timer.apply_after for non-blocking scheduled retries
**Test to Run:** `mix test test/foundation/infrastructure/pool_workers/http_worker_test.exs`

### 7-11. /lib/foundation/infrastructure/pool_workers/http_worker.ex (Lines 327,340,359,379,384)
**Current Code:**
```elixir
Process.sleep(Enum.random(10..100))
```
**Problem:** Random blocking delays in HTTP operations
**Fix Strategy:** Use Process.send_after with random intervals and message handling
**Test to Run:** `mix test test/foundation/infrastructure/pool_workers/http_worker_test.exs`

### 12. /lib/foundation/mabeam/coordination.ex:231
**Current Code:**
```elixir
Process.sleep(50)
```
**Problem:** Race condition hack in coordination protocol
**Fix Strategy:** Use proper GenServer synchronization and state machines
**Test to Run:** `mix test test/foundation/mabeam/coordination_test.exs`

### 13. /lib/foundation/mabeam/coordination.ex:4096
**Current Code:**
```elixir
Process.sleep(total_delay)
```
**Problem:** Blocking delay in coordination timing
**Fix Strategy:** Use GenServer timer with handle_info/2 for scheduled operations
**Test to Run:** `mix test test/foundation/mabeam/coordination_test.exs`

### 14. /lib/foundation/beam/processes.ex:194
**Current Code:**
```elixir
Process.sleep(50)
```
**Problem:** Blocking wait in process lifecycle management
**Fix Strategy:** Use Process.monitor with proper message handling
**Test to Run:** `mix test test/foundation/beam/processes_test.exs`

### 15. /lib/foundation/beam/processes.ex:209
**Current Code:**
```elixir
Process.sleep(10)
```
**Problem:** Race condition hack in process startup
**Fix Strategy:** Use GenServer.start_link with proper initialization callbacks
**Test to Run:** `mix test test/foundation/beam/processes_test.exs`

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH (TEST-DRIVEN)

### For Each Sleep Function:
1. **READ** the specific file and understand the context
2. **IDENTIFY** why the sleep was used (race condition, timing, retry, etc.)
3. **IMPLEMENT** proper concurrent solution:
   - GenServer calls for synchronization
   - Process.monitor for process lifecycle
   - Process.send_after for scheduling
   - receive blocks for message handling
4. **TEST** the specific module immediately after changes
5. **VERIFY** no regressions in related functionality

### Proper Concurrency Patterns to Use:

#### Instead of Process.sleep for retries:
```elixir
# BAD
Process.sleep(delay)
retry_operation()

# GOOD  
Process.send_after(self(), :retry, delay)
receive do
  :retry -> retry_operation()
end
```

#### Instead of Process.sleep for synchronization:
```elixir
# BAD
Process.sleep(50)  # hope process is ready

# GOOD
GenServer.call(process, :wait_ready, timeout)
```

#### Instead of Process.sleep for process cleanup:
```elixir
# BAD
Process.exit(pid, :kill)
Process.sleep(100)  # hope it's dead

# GOOD
ref = Process.monitor(pid)
Process.exit(pid, :shutdown)
receive do
  {:DOWN, ^ref, :process, ^pid, _reason} -> :ok
after 5000 -> 
  Process.exit(pid, :kill)
end
```

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES
- **Zero** Process.sleep calls in production lib/ code
- **Proper** OTP-compliant concurrent patterns
- **Faster** test execution (no arbitrary waits)
- **More reliable** process coordination
- **Better** error handling and fault tolerance

## NOTES
- The /lib/foundation/utils.ex:399 sleep is in a doctest example and can remain
- All test files will be addressed separately after lib/ fixes are complete
- Each fix must be tested immediately to prevent regressions
- No shortcuts, no placeholders - proper implementation required
