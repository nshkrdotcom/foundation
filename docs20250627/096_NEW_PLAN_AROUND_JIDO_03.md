Excellent. This is the logical next step: translating the conceptual architecture into a concrete, organized codebase within a single monorepo.

The goal is to structure the `foundation` repository so that it contains not just the "kernel" but also the "runtime" and "application" layers as distinct OTP applications within its `lib/` directory. This creates a powerful, cohesive system that is easy to navigate, test, and extend.

Here is the proposed monorepo layout and a discussion of the rationale.

### High-Level Monorepo Structure

We will structure the codebase into three primary OTP applications residing inside the `foundation/lib/` directory. This creates a clear dependency hierarchy where higher layers depend on lower layers, but not the other way around.

*   `foundation/lib/foundation_kernel`: **Tier 1 (The Kernel)** - The stable, generic infrastructure.
*   `foundation/lib/jido_runtime`: **Tier 2 (The Agent Runtime)** - The programming model and execution engine for agents.
*   `foundation/lib/jido_mabeam`: **Tier 3 (The Application Logic)** - The specific business and coordination logic implemented as agents.

**Dependency Flow:** `jido_mabeam` -> `jido_runtime` -> `foundation_kernel`

### Discussion of the Hierarchy and Component Placement

#### Tier 1: `foundation_kernel`

This application is the stable core. Its existence justifies the entire architecture by providing a clear separation between infrastructure and application logic.

*   **Role**: To provide a reliable, generic, and observable OTP platform. It knows nothing about "agents" or "actions."
*   **Supervision**: `foundation_kernel/application.ex` is the root supervisor. It starts the `ProcessRegistry`, `ConfigServer`, `EventStore`, `TelemetryService`, and any other foundational services.
*   **Why here?**:
    *   **`ProcessRegistry`**: It's the DNS of the system. It *must* be stable and available before anything else.
    *   **`Infrastructure/*`**: Resilience patterns like `CircuitBreaker` are generic. An `Action` in Tier 3 might use a circuit breaker to call an external LLM API, but the circuit breaker itself doesn't know or care what an LLM is.
    *   **`Services/*`**: These are singleton services essential for the entire system's operation, like configuration and telemetry.

#### Tier 2: `jido_runtime`

This application is the heart of the agent programming model. It's the fusion of the three original `jido` libraries into a single, cohesive unit.

*   **Role**: To provide the tools and environment for building, running, and communicating between agents. It defines *how* an agent works.
*   **Supervision**: `jido_runtime/application.ex` starts the services essential for the agent runtime, such as the `Jido.Signal.Bus` and a top-level `DynamicSupervisor` for managing all agents (`Jido.Agent.Supervisor`).
*   **Why here?**:
    *   **`agent.ex`, `action.ex`, `skill.ex`**: These files contain the `use` macros and behaviors that form the Developer Experience (DX) for creating new components. They are the public API of the runtime.
    *   **`agent/server.ex`**: This is the `GenServer` implementation behind `use Jido.Agent`. It's an internal detail of the runtime.
    *   **`signal/*`**: This is the complete, self-contained nervous system for the agents. It is generic enough to pass any message but is conceptually part of the agent runtime.

#### Tier 3: `jido_mabeam`

This is where the domain-specific logic lives. We take the high-level *concepts* from the original `mabeam` library and implement them using the Jido Runtime primitives.

*   **Role**: To implement the specific business logic and coordination strategies of the multi-agent system.
*   **Supervision**: `jido_mabeam/application.ex` is responsible for starting the long-running "system agents" like the `AuctioneerAgent` and `MarketplaceAgent`.
*   **Why here?**:
    *   **`agents/auctioneer_agent.ex`**: Instead of a simple `GenServer`, this is now a full `Jido.Agent`. It holds the state for all active auctions.
    *   **`skills/auction_management_skill.ex`**: This skill can be attached to the `AuctioneerAgent`. It bundles all the actions related to managing auctions. This promotes modularity and reuse.
    *   **`actions/auction/create_auction.ex`**: A single, self-contained, testable `Jido.Action` that knows how to create an auction. It encapsulates the "verb" of the system.
    *   **`types/auction.ex`**: The specific data structures (`Auction`, `Bid`, etc.) are now colocated with their domain logic, improving cohesion.

| `MABEAM.AgentSupervisor` | *N/A* | **Replaced**. Agent supervision is handled by the `Jido.Agent.Server` and its parent supervisor in Tier 2. |
| `MABEAM.Comms` | *N/A* | **Replaced**. `Jido.Signal.Bus` in Tier 2 is the new communication backbone. |
| `MABEAM.Coordination.*` | `jido_mabeam/` | **Concept Migrated**. Re-implemented as `Jido.Agents`, `Jido.Skills`, and `Jido.Actions` in Tier 3. |
| `MABEAM.Economics` | `jido_mabeam/` | **Concept Migrated**. Re-implemented as `Jido.Agents` and `Jido.Skills` in Tier 3. |
| `MABEAM.Core` | *N/A* | **Replaced**. Responsibilities are split between `Foundation.ConfigServer` (Tier 1) and specialized Tier 3 agents. |
| **`jido`, `jido_action`, `jido_signal`** | `jido_runtime/` | **Merged & Organized**. These libraries are fused into a single, cohesive OTP application that forms the core of Tier 2. |

This monorepo structure achieves the goals of a robust, multi-tier architecture. It enforces a strict separation of concerns, promotes high cohesion and low coupling, and provides a clear, scalable path for future development while leveraging the best parts of all the provided libraries.
