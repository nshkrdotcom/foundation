## Documentation Tasks 📚

### Create EXAMPLES.md ⏳
**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 week

**Key Files to Reference**:
- All test files in `/test/foundation/` and `/test/foundation/mabeam/`
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Implementation overview
- `/docs/MABEAM_API_REFERENCE.md` - API documentation

**Content to Include**:

## Current Dialyzer Issues to Fix 🚨

**Priority**: Immediate  
**Files Affected**: 4 MABEAM modules

### 1. ProcessRegistry.register Contract Violations
**Files**: `agent_registry.ex:139`, `coordination.ex:124`, `economics.ex:190`, `telemetry.ex:155`

**Issue**: Contract expects specific return types but calls don't match

**Root Cause**: ProcessRegistry.register function contract may be too restrictive

**Fix Approach**: Update either the contract or the calling code to match

### 2. Pattern Matching Issues
**File**: `coordination.ex:1974`

**Issue**: `nil` pattern can never match `map()` type

**Root Cause**: Function type signature guarantees map input but code handles nil

**Fix Approach**: Update function signature or remove impossible pattern

### 3. Function Return Issues  
**Files**: `coordination.ex:109`, `telemetry.ex:500`

**Issue**: Functions have no local return or break contracts

**Root Cause**: Logic paths that don't return expected types

**Fix Approach**: Ensure all code paths return expected types

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- **No Shortcuts**: Complete, robust implementations only
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Fix underlying issues, not symptoms  
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All features must have thorough test coverage
- **Documentation**: All public APIs must be documented with examples
- **Type Safety**: All functions must have proper type specifications
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and recovery patterns

### Architecture Principles
- **Distribution-First**: All designs must support multi-node deployment
- **ML-Native**: Coordination algorithms optimized for ML/LLM workflows
- **Cost-Aware**: Built-in cost optimization and budget management
- **Performance-Focused**: Sub-millisecond latency for critical paths
- **Fault-Tolerant**: Byzantine fault tolerance for mission-critical operations

### Development Workflow
1. **Read Context**: Study relevant files and documentation
2. **Design Phase**: Plan implementation with type signatures
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
4. **Implementation**: Build features incrementally
5. **Integration Testing**: Verify end-to-end functionality
