# Foundation-Jido Complete Integration Plan

## Overview

This comprehensive plan merges the Jido integration roadmap (JIDO_PLAN.md) with the infrastructure rebuild strategy (LIB_OLD_PORT_PLAN.md) to create a **sound architectural foundation** for production-grade Jido agents. The plan emphasizes proper supervision, protocol-based coupling, and infrastructure services that support robust agent operations.

## Current Status Summary

- **Test Failures**: 28 failures in test suite (down from initial failures)
- **Core Integration**: ~60% complete with basic Jido-Foundation bridge

- **Production Ready**: Circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, monitoring
- **Performance**: <5% overhead vs pure Jido
- **Resilience**: Graceful degradation and error isolation

- **Stage 3**: Event persistence and signal processing working
- **Stage 4**: Complete monitoring and alerting pipeline
- **Stage 5**: Optimized performance and advanced patterns

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Each Stage:
1. **Read Context**: Study specified documents and current implementations
2. **Test Drive**: Write failing tests for new functionality
3. **Implement**: Build with supervision-first, protocol-based architecture
4. **Integrate**: Connect new services with existing Jido agents
5. **Validate**: Ensure all tests pass and no regressions

### Architecture Principles:
- **Supervision First**: Every process under proper supervision
- **Protocol Based**: Use Foundation protocols for all integrations
- **Error Boundaries**: Services fail independently with circuit breakers
- **Clean Coupling**: Jido agents use Foundation services via protocols
- **Production Ready**: All services designed for production deployment

This plan transforms the current basic Jido integration into a production-grade multi-agent platform with robust infrastructure, monitoring, and error handling while maintaining the sound architectural principles established in the current Foundation system.
