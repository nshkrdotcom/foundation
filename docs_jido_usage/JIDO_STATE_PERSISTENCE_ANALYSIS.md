# Jido State Persistence Analysis

## Summary

**Jido DOES provide clean mechanisms for state persistence without framework modifications.**

## Available Persistence Hooks

### 1. `mount/2` Callback
- Called when agent server starts
- Perfect place to restore persisted state
- Receives server state and options
- Can modify initial agent state

### 2. `shutdown/2` Callback
- Called when agent is terminating
- Ideal for saving final state
- Receives server state and shutdown reason

### 3. `initial_state` Parameter
- Pass initial state when creating agent: `new(id, initial_state)`
- Pass initial state when starting: `start_link(id: id, initial_state: saved_state)`
- State is merged with schema defaults and validated

### 4. State Change Hooks
- `on_after_validate_state/1` - Called after every state change
- `on_after_run/3` - Called after action execution
- Perfect for incremental state persistence

## Clean Implementation Pattern

```elixir
defmodule PersistentAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "persistent_agent",
    schema: [data: [type: :map, default: %{}]]

  # Restore state on startup
  def mount(%{agent: agent} = server_state, _opts) do
    case load_state(agent.id) do
      {:ok, state} ->
        {:ok, %{server_state | agent: %{agent | state: state}}}
      _ ->
        {:ok, server_state}
    end
  end

  # Save state on shutdown
  def shutdown(%{agent: agent} = server_state, _reason) do
    save_state(agent.id, agent.state)
    {:ok, server_state}
  end

  # Save after every state change
  def on_after_validate_state(agent) do
    save_state(agent.id, agent.state)
    {:ok, agent}
  end
end
```

## No Framework Modifications Needed

The Jido framework already provides:
1. Clean lifecycle hooks for state management
2. Multiple integration points for persistence
3. Flexible initialization with restored state
4. No hacking or workarounds required

## Conclusion

The initial assessment that Jido "doesn't provide clean hooks" was incorrect. Jido is well-designed for state persistence with multiple clean integration points. No issue needs to be filed with Jido maintainers.
