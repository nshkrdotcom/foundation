# MABEAM Decoupling Analysis

This document analyzes the MABEAM feature and outlines the process of refactoring it into a separate, higher-level library.

## MABEAM Overview

MABEAM (Multi-Agent BEAM) is a feature of the Foundation layer that provides a framework for building multi-agent systems. It includes components for:

*   **Agent Management**: `MABEAM.Agent` and `MABEAM.AgentSupervisor` provide a way to define and manage agents.
*   **Agent Registry**: `MABEAM.AgentRegistry` provides a way to register and discover agents.
*   **Communication**: `MABEAM.Comms` provides a way for agents to communicate with each other.
*   **Coordination**: `MABEAM.Coordination` provides a set of coordination primitives for building multi-agent systems.
*   **Economics**: `MABEAM.Economics` provides a way to model and simulate economic interactions between agents.
*   **Telemetry**: `MABEAM.Telemetry` provides a way to collect and report telemetry data for MABEAM systems.

## Decoupling Analysis

The MABEAM feature is largely decoupled from the core Foundation layer. It relies on the following Foundation services:

*   **`Foundation.ProcessRegistry`**: MABEAM uses the process registry to register and discover agents.
*   **`Foundation.Telemetry`**: MABEAM uses the telemetry service to collect and report telemetry data.
*   **`Foundation.Coordination`**: MABEAM uses the coordination primitives to build its own higher-level coordination services.

The MABEAM components themselves are relatively self-contained and do not have any circular dependencies on the core Foundation layer. This makes it a good candidate for extraction into a separate library.

## Refactoring Plan

The following steps would be involved in refactoring MABEAM into a separate library:

1.  **Create a new Mix project**: Create a new Mix project for the MABEAM library.
2.  **Move MABEAM source code**: Move the MABEAM source code from the `lib/foundation/mabeam` directory to the new Mix project.
3.  **Update dependencies**: Add the Foundation library as a dependency to the new MABEAM library.
4.  **Update namespaces**: Update the namespaces in the MABEAM source code to reflect the new library structure.
5.  **Update Foundation layer**: Remove the MABEAM source code from the Foundation layer and add the new MABEAM library as a dependency.
6.  **Update documentation**: Update the documentation to reflect the new library structure.

By following these steps, the MABEAM feature can be successfully refactored into a separate, higher-level library. This will make the Foundation layer more modular and easier to maintain, and it will allow the MABEAM library to be used in other projects.
