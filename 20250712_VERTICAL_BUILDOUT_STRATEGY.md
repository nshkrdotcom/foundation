# ElixirML Vertical Buildout Strategy - Minimal Testable Features

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a vertical buildout strategy that emphasizes rapid delivery of minimal testable features to validate the ElixirML architecture. Based on evolutionary analysis insights, we focus on thin vertical slices that prove the complete system works end-to-end, rather than building complete horizontal layers.

## Vertical vs Horizontal Development

### Traditional Horizontal Approach (Avoid)
```
Month 1: [Foundation Layer - Complete]
Month 2: [Variable System - Complete]  
Month 3: [Agent System - Complete]
Month 4: [Integration Testing]
```
**Problems**: No working features until Month 4, high integration risk, late validation

### Vertical Slice Approach (Embrace)
```
Month 1: [QA Pipeline - Foundation + Variables + Agents + Signatures]
Month 2: [Multi-Agent - Add coordination to existing stack]
Month 3: [Real-Time - Add adaptation to existing stack] 
Month 4: [Scientific - Add evaluation to existing stack]
```
**Benefits**: Working features every month, early validation, reduced integration risk

## Vertical Slice Specifications

### Slice 1: Basic QA Pipeline (Month 1)
**Theme**: "Hello World" for revolutionary AI platform

#### Minimal Feature Set
- Native DSPy signature syntax works
- Single cognitive variable coordinates pipeline
- One agent processes questions  
- Foundation supervision handles failures
- Basic telemetry shows system health

#### Technical Scope
```elixir
# Application Layer - Minimal DSPy compatibility
defmodule BasicQA do
  use ElixirML.Signature
  
  @doc "Answer questions with context"
  signature "question: str, context?: str -> answer: str, confidence: float"
end

# Variable Layer - Single variable type
cognitive_variable :temperature, :float,
  range: {0.0, 2.0},
  default: 0.7,
  coordination_scope: :pipeline

# Agent Layer - Single agent type  
defmodule QAAgent do
  use ElixirML.Foundation.Agent
  
  def process_question(question, context, temperature) do
    # Mock LLM call with temperature coordination
    answer = generate_answer(question, context, temperature)
    confidence = calculate_confidence(answer)
    %{answer: answer, confidence: confidence}
  end
end

# Foundation Layer - Essential services only
Foundation.EventBus         # Basic pub/sub
Foundation.ResourceManager  # Memory/CPU tracking
Foundation.Supervisor      # OTP supervision
Foundation.Telemetry       # Basic metrics
```

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] DSPy signature compiles without errors
- [ ] Variable.set(:temperature, 0.8) affects QA processing
- [ ] QA pipeline processes 100 questions without failure  
- [ ] Agent crash triggers supervisor restart
- [ ] Telemetry shows variable coordination events

#### Test-First Implementation
```elixir
test "complete QA pipeline with variable coordination" do
  # Initialize system
  {:ok, _} = QASystem.start_link()
  
  # Test signature compilation
  assert BasicQA.__signature__() != nil
  
  # Test variable coordination
  assert :ok = Variable.set(:temperature, 0.8)
  
  # Test pipeline processing
  result = QASystem.process("What is Elixir?", context: "Elixir is a programming language")
  
  assert result.answer != nil
  assert result.confidence > 0.0
  assert result.temperature == 0.8  # Variable coordination worked
  
  # Test supervision 
  agent_pid = QASystem.get_agent_pid()
  Process.exit(agent_pid, :kill)
  :timer.sleep(100)  # Allow supervisor to restart
  
  # Should still work after restart
  result2 = QASystem.process("What is AI?")
  assert result2.answer != nil
