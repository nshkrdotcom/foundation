  infrastructure_impl: MockInfrastructure
```

### Test Fixtures
- Mock agents with various capabilities
- Pre-configured variable spaces
- Sample ML pipelines
- Test coordination scenarios

## Test Execution Strategy

### Continuous Integration
1. **On Every Commit**:
   - Unit tests
   - Fast integration tests
   - Dialyzer type checking
   - Credo code quality

2. **Nightly**:
   - Full integration suite
   - Property-based tests
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Stress tests

### Local Development
```bash
# Fast feedback loop
mix test --only unit

# Before pushing
mix test
mix dialyzer
mix credo --strict
```

## Known Issues & Mitigations

### Test Isolation
- **Issue**: Parallel test execution causes registry conflicts
- **Mitigation**: Use unique registry IDs per test
- **Long-term**: Implement test-specific registry isolation

### Timing Dependencies
- **Issue**: Some tests rely on timing
- **Mitigation**: Use explicit synchronization
- **Long-term**: Remove all timing dependencies

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (This Sprint):
   - Complete MLFoundation module tests
   - Add property-based tests for registries
   - Performance benchmark suite

2. **Next Sprint**:
   - Stress test implementation
   - Chaos testing framework
   - Load testing scenarios

3. **Future**:
   - Distributed test scenarios
   - Multi-node testing
   - Production simulation tests

## Test Metrics & Reporting
