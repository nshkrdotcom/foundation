# Foundation.ProcessRegistry Formal Specification
**Phase 0: Complete System Specification (Design-Only)**

## Executive Summary

The Foundation.ProcessRegistry is a critical infrastructure component providing agent-aware process discovery and coordination for multi-agent BEAM systems. This specification defines the formal mathematical model, invariants, safety properties, and performance guarantees that the implementation must satisfy.

**Core Responsibility**: Maintain a consistent, high-performance mapping from process identifiers to live processes with rich metadata, enabling sophisticated agent coordination patterns.

## 1. Domain Modeling and Formal Specifications

### 1.1 State Invariants (Must Always Be True)

```
ProcessRegistry State Invariants:

I1. Registry Consistency:
    ∀ process_id ∈ registry_table:
        process_id → (pid, metadata) ∧ Process.alive?(pid) = true

I2. Index Consistency:
    ∀ capability ∈ capability_index:
        capability → process_id ⇒ 
        ∃ (pid, metadata) : registry_table[process_id] = (pid, metadata) ∧
        capability ∈ metadata.capabilities

I3. Namespace Isolation:
    ∀ p1, p2 ∈ registry_table:
        p1.namespace ≠ p2.namespace ⇒ 
        p1.local_id = p2.local_id ∧ p1.node = p2.node is valid

I4. Metadata Schema Compliance:
    ∀ (pid, metadata) ∈ registry_table:
        metadata conforms to agent_metadata() typespec

I5. Monitor Consistency:
    ∀ monitor_ref ∈ monitors:
        monitor_ref → process_id ⇒ 
        ∃ (pid, metadata) : registry_table[process_id] = (pid, metadata)

I6. Dead Process Cleanup:
    ∀ process_id ∈ registry_table:
        Process.alive?(registry_table[process_id].pid) = false ⇒
        process_id will be removed within cleanup_window_ms
```

### 1.2 Safety Properties (Must Never Happen)

```
ProcessRegistry Safety Properties:

S1. No Dual Registration:
    ∄ process_id : |{(pid, metadata) : registry_table[process_id] = (pid, metadata)}| > 1

S2. No Ghost Processes:
    ∄ process_id ∈ registry_table : Process.alive?(registry_table[process_id].pid) = false
    (except during cleanup_window_ms)

S3. No Index Corruption:
    ∄ inconsistent state where index entries point to non-existent registry entries

S4. No Memory Leaks:
    registry_memory_usage ≤ live_process_count × average_metadata_size + bounded_overhead

S5. No Race Condition Corruption:
    Concurrent operations cannot leave registry in inconsistent state

S6. No Silent Failures:
    All registration/lookup failures must return explicit error tuples

S7. No Namespace Pollution:
    Process in namespace N cannot be discovered via queries for namespace M where N ≠ M
```

### 1.3 Liveness Properties (Must Eventually Happen)

```
ProcessRegistry Liveness Properties:

L1. Registration Completion:
    ∀ register(process_id, pid, metadata) request:
        request completes with {:ok} or {:error, reason} within registration_timeout_ms

L2. Lookup Response:
    ∀ lookup(process_id) request:
        request returns result within lookup_timeout_ms

L3. Dead Process Cleanup:
    ∀ process termination event:
        cleanup completes within cleanup_window_ms

L4. System Responsiveness:
    Registry remains responsive to new requests even under maximum designed load

L5. Index Convergence:
    After metadata updates, index queries reflect changes within index_consistency_window_ms

L6. Monitor Processing:
    Process death notifications are processed within monitor_processing_window_ms
```

### 1.4 Performance Guarantees

```
ProcessRegistry Performance Specifications:

P1. Lookup Performance:
    lookup(process_id) completes in O(1) time regardless of registry size
    Target: < 1ms for registries up to 100,000 processes

P2. Registration Performance:
    register(process_id, pid, metadata) completes in O(k) time 
    where k = number of capabilities in metadata
    Target: < 5ms for typical agent metadata

P3. Query Performance:
    find_by_capability(capability) completes in O(n) time
    where n = number of processes with that capability
    Target: < 10ms for up to 1,000 matching processes

P4. Memory Efficiency:
    Total memory usage ≤ process_count × (base_entry_size + metadata_size) × memory_overhead_factor
    where memory_overhead_factor ≤ 2.0

P5. Concurrent Access:
    Registry supports unlimited concurrent readers with no blocking
    Registry supports up to concurrent_write_limit writers with bounded blocking

P6. Cleanup Performance:
    Dead process cleanup completes in O(k) time where k = number of capabilities
    Target: < 2ms per cleanup operation
```

## 2. Data Structure Specifications

### 2.1 Process Registry Entry
```elixir
ProcessEntry ::= {
  process_id: {namespace(), node(), local_id()},
  pid: pid(),
  metadata: AgentMetadata,
  registered_at: MonotonicTimestamp,
  last_updated: MonotonicTimestamp
}

Mathematical Properties:
- process_id must be unique within registry
- pid must be alive when entry exists  
- registered_at ≤ last_updated
- namespace cannot be nil
- metadata must satisfy agent_metadata() typespec
```

### 2.2 Agent Metadata Structure
```elixir
AgentMetadata ::= %{
  type: AgentType,                          // Required for type queries
  capabilities: [Capability],               // Required for capability queries  
  resources: ResourceMap,                   // Optional resource tracking
  coordination_variables: [VariableName],   // Optional coordination context
  health_status: HealthStatus,              // Required for health queries
  node_affinity: [Node],                    // Optional distribution hint
  created_at: DateTime,                     // Required audit trail
  last_health_check: DateTime,              // Required health tracking
  custom: Map                               // Optional extensibility
}

Type Constraints:
- type ∈ {:agent, :service, :coordinator, :resource_manager}
- capabilities ⊆ valid_capability_atoms()
- health_status ∈ {:healthy, :degraded, :unhealthy}  
- created_at ≤ last_health_check ≤ current_time()
```

### 2.3 Index Structure Design
```
Index Architecture:

Main Registry Table:
  Key: process_id = {namespace, node, local_id}
  Value: {pid, metadata}
  Properties: unique keys, read_concurrency, write_concurrency

Capability Index:
  Key: capability (atom)
  Value: process_id  
  Properties: duplicate_bag (one capability -> many processes)

Type Index:
  Key: agent_type
  Value: process_id
  Properties: duplicate_bag (one type -> many processes)

Health Index:
  Key: health_status
  Value: process_id
  Properties: duplicate_bag (one status -> many processes)

Monitor Map:
  Key: monitor_reference  
  Value: process_id
  Properties: unique keys, in-memory GenServer state
```

## 3. Concurrency Model Verification

### 3.1 Read Operations (Lockfree)
```
Read Operation Concurrency Model:

Lookup Operations:
├── lookup(process_id) 
│   - Lock-free ETS :lookup operation
│   - Process.alive/1 validation (lockfree)
│   - Atomic read of consistent state
│   - No writer blocking
├── find_by_capability(capability)
│   - Lock-free ETS :lookup on capability_index  
│   - Lock-free main table lookup for each result
│   - Process.alive/1 validation for each
│   - Consistent snapshot semantics
└── Statistical queries (list_all, find_by_type, find_by_health)
    - Lock-free ETS pattern matching
    - Eventual consistency guarantees
    - No blocking on concurrent writes

Consistency Guarantee: All read operations return point-in-time consistent snapshots
```

### 3.2 Write Operations (Synchronized)
```
Write Operation Concurrency Model:

Registration Flow:
1. GenServer.call ensures serialized access to state
2. ETS :lookup for existence check (atomic)
3. ETS :insert operations (atomic per table)
4. Process.monitor (atomic)
5. State update (atomic within GenServer)

Ordering Guarantee: namespace → process_id → metadata → indexes
Atomicity: Either all ETS updates succeed or none (via GenServer serialization)

Cleanup Flow (Triggered by process death):
1. Process DOWN message received
2. Lookup process_id from monitor_ref
3. Atomic removal from all ETS tables
4. Monitor cleanup
5. State update

Deadlock Prevention: Single lock ordering, no nested GenServer calls
```

### 3.3 Process Monitoring Strategy
```
Process Lifecycle Management:

Monitor Creation:
- Process.monitor(pid) called immediately after registration
- monitor_ref stored in GenServer state
- Automatic cleanup on process termination

Death Detection:
- {:DOWN, monitor_ref, :process, pid, reason} message
- O(1) lookup of process_id via monitor_ref
- Immediate cleanup of all indexes

Race Condition Handling:
- Registration of dead process: prevented by Process.alive/1 check
- Death during registration: cleanup handles orphaned entries
- Concurrent death and unregistration: idempotent cleanup operations
```

## 4. Failure Mode Analysis with Recovery Guarantees

### 4.1 Process Registry Crash Recovery
```
Failure Scenario: ProcessRegistry GenServer crashes

Impact Analysis:
- All ETS tables are lost (linked to GenServer process)
- All process monitors are lost
- Registry becomes unavailable

Recovery Strategy:
1. ProcessRegistry restarts via OTP supervision
2. ETS tables recreated with same configuration
3. No automatic state reconstruction (by design)
4. Processes must re-register themselves

Recovery Time: < 100ms for restart + re-registration
Data Loss: Acceptable (processes should re-register on startup)
Availability: Brief unavailability during restart

Prevention: Supervisor with :permanent restart, exponential backoff
```

### 4.2 Memory Exhaustion
```
Failure Scenario: Registry memory usage exceeds system limits

Early Warning Indicators:
- ETS table size monitoring  
- Memory usage growth rate tracking
- Process registration rate alerts

Response Strategy:
1. Immediate: Stop accepting new registrations
2. Short-term: Force cleanup of stale entries
3. Medium-term: Implement registration limits per namespace
4. Long-term: Scale to clustered deployment

Graceful Degradation:
- Core functionality (lookup) remains available
- New registrations fail with {:error, :registry_full}
- Cleanup prioritizes by process age and health status

Recovery: Automatic when memory usage drops below threshold
```

### 4.3 Network Partition (Future)
```
Failure Scenario: Network partition in distributed deployment

Current Behavior: Single-node deployment unaffected

Future Distributed Behavior:
- Each partition maintains local consistency
- No split-brain registry corruption
- Partition healing triggers reconciliation

Reconciliation Strategy:
- Process liveness verification across nodes
- Conflict resolution: prefer local registrations
- Metadata merge with last-writer-wins semantics

Design Consideration: Process IDs include node() for partition tolerance
```

### 4.4 Concurrent Write Storm
```
Failure Scenario: Massive concurrent registration requests

Protection Mechanisms:
1. GenServer serialization prevents corruption
2. ETS write_concurrency enables parallel index updates
3. Process.monitor rate limiting (system-level)
4. Registration timeout prevents indefinite queuing

Backpressure Strategy:
- Queue depth monitoring in GenServer
- Adaptive timeout adjustment
- Circuit breaker pattern for protection
- Graceful rejection with {:error, :system_busy}

Performance Degradation:
- Linear degradation with request rate
- No corruption or data loss
- Consistent response to overload
```

## 5. API Contract Specifications

### 5.1 Registration Contracts
```elixir
@contract register(process_id(), pid(), agent_metadata()) :: :ok | {:error, reason()}
  where:
    requires: 
      - Process.alive?(pid) = true
      - valid_process_id?(process_id) = true  
      - valid_metadata?(metadata) = true
    ensures: 
      - lookup(process_id) returns {:ok, pid, metadata}
      - process appears in relevant indexes
      - process death triggers automatic cleanup
    exceptional: 
      - {:error, :already_registered} when process_id already exists
      - {:error, :invalid_metadata} when metadata invalid
      - {:error, :dead_process} when Process.alive?(pid) = false
    timing: 
      - completes within 10ms under normal load
      - completes within 50ms under high load
    concurrency: 
      - safe for unlimited concurrent calls
      - serialized within single registry instance
```

### 5.2 Lookup Contracts  
```elixir
@contract lookup(process_id()) :: {:ok, pid(), metadata()} | :error
  where:
    requires:
      - valid_process_id?(process_id) = true
    ensures:
      - if {:ok, pid, metadata} then Process.alive?(pid) = true
      - if :error then process_id not in registry or process dead
    exceptional:
      - :error for non-existent or dead processes
    timing:
      - completes within 1ms under normal load
      - completes within 5ms under extreme load
    concurrency:
      - completely lock-free
      - unlimited concurrent readers
      - never blocks on writers
```

### 5.3 Query Contracts
```elixir
@contract find_by_capability(capability()) :: {:ok, [registry_entry()]}
  where:
    requires:
      - is_atom(capability) = true
    ensures:
      - all returned processes have capability in metadata.capabilities
      - all returned pids are alive
      - results represent consistent point-in-time snapshot
    timing:
      - O(n) where n = number of processes with capability
      - completes within 10ms for up to 1000 matching processes
    concurrency:
      - lock-free operation
      - eventually consistent with concurrent metadata updates
```
