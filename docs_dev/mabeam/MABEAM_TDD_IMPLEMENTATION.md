# MABEAM TDD Implementation Plan for Foundation

## Overview

This document outlines the Test-Driven Development (TDD) implementation of MABEAM (Multi-Agent BEAM) in the Foundation library. The implementation follows a phased approach with stability checkpoints at each step, ensuring no warnings, dialyzer passes, and credo --strict compliance before proceeding.

## Implementation Philosophy

- **TDD First**: Every module starts with comprehensive tests
- **Stability Checkpoints**: Each step must pass all quality gates before proceeding
- **Incremental Development**: Small, focused changes that build upon each other
- **Quality Gates**: No warnings, dialyzer clean, credo --strict compliant, formatted

## Quality Gates Checklist

Before each human review/commit checkpoint:

```bash
# 1. Format code
mix format

# 2. Check for warnings
mix compile --warnings-as-errors

# 3. Run dialyzer
mix dialyzer

# 4. Run strict credo
mix credo --strict

# 5. Run tests
mix test

# 6. Check test coverage
mix test --cover
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Foundation.MABEAM.Core)
**Duration**: 4-6 development cycles
**Goal**: Establish the universal variable orchestrator with basic agent management

### Phase 2: Agent Registry and Lifecycle (Foundation.MABEAM.AgentRegistry)
**Duration**: 3-4 development cycles  
**Goal**: Implement robust agent lifecycle management with OTP supervision

### Phase 3: Basic Coordination (Foundation.MABEAM.Coordination)
**Duration**: 4-5 development cycles
**Goal**: Implement fundamental coordination protocols (consensus, negotiation)

### Phase 4: Advanced Coordination (Foundation.MABEAM.Coordination.*)
**Duration**: 5-6 development cycles
**Goal**: Implement sophisticated coordination strategies (auction, market-based)

### Phase 5: Telemetry and Monitoring (Foundation.MABEAM.Telemetry)
**Duration**: 2-3 development cycles
**Goal**: Comprehensive observability for multi-agent systems

### Phase 6: Integration and Polish
**Duration**: 2-3 development cycles
**Goal**: Final integration, documentation, and performance optimization

## Human Review Points

Each step ends with a human review checkpoint where the developer:
1. Verifies all quality gates pass
2. Reviews code for architectural consistency
3. Confirms tests provide adequate coverage
4. Validates documentation is complete
5. Commits the stable increment

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Begin with `MABEAM_PHASE_01_CORE.md`
2. **Follow TDD Cycle**: Red → Green → Refactor for each step
3. **Maintain Quality**: Ensure all quality gates pass at each checkpoint
4. **Human Review**: Stop at each checkpoint for review and commit
5. **Document Progress**: Update this file with completion status
