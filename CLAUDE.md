# JIDO FOUNDATION SYSTEM RECOVERY

## JIDO ARCHITECTURE CONTEXT

### What is Jido?
Jido (自動) is a toolkit for building autonomous, distributed agent systems in Elixir. The name comes from the Japanese word meaning "automatic" or "automated", where 自 (ji) means "self" and 動 (dō) means "movement".

**Key Jido Concepts:**
- **Actions**: Fundamental building blocks - discrete, composable units of functionality
- **Agents**: Stateful entities that can plan and execute Actions, built on OTP GenServer
- **Sensors**: Real-time monitoring and data gathering components
- **Instructions**: Event-driven messages that coordinate workflows
- **Workflows**: Composable chains of Actions for complex behaviors

### Foundation JidoSystem Integration

The Foundation layer provides protocol-based infrastructure for Jido agents:

- **Registry Protocol**: Agent discovery and lifecycle management
- **Coordination Protocol**: Multi-agent orchestration and communication  
- **Infrastructure Protocol**: Shared services (caching, telemetry, etc.)
- **MABEAM**: Multi-Agent BEAM orchestration for distributed coordination

**JidoSystem Agents:**
- **TaskAgent**: Processes discrete units of work with queue management
- **MonitorAgent**: Collects metrics and monitors system health
- **CoordinatorAgent**: Orchestrates workflows and manages agent coordination
- **FoundationAgent**: Bridge pattern connecting Jido agents to Foundation infrastructure

### Design Principles

Jido follows core principles that guide this Foundation implementation:

1. **Error Tuples Over Exceptions**: Explicit error handling with `{:ok, result}` / `{:error, reason}`
2. **Data-First Architecture**: Focus on data transformation over behavioral inheritance
3. **Rich Compile-Time Discovery**: Metadata for introspection and validation
4. **Event-Driven Processing**: Actions and instructions as communication primitives
5. **Agents as Dynamic ETL**: Extract-Transform-Load processing with composition
6. **Balanced Data Validation**: "Validate what you know" approach for flexibility
7. **Robust Error Recovery**: OTP supervision with graceful degradation

# CLAUDE RECOVERY EXECUTION PROTOCOL

## MISSION: COMPLETE FOUNDATION JIDOSYSTEM RECOVERY
**DURATION**: HOURS AND HOURS WITHOUT STOPPING
**COMPLETION CRITERIA**: ALL 6 PHASES 100% COMPLETE

## EXECUTION RULES
1. **DO NOT STOP FOR ANY REASON**
2. **NO HELP REQUESTS**
3. **NO QUESTIONS**
4. **PERFECT COMPLETED FUNCTIONALITY ONLY**

## PHASE COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS
Each phase MUST meet ALL criteria before commit:
- ✅ ALL TESTS PASSING (281/281)
- ✅ NO WARNINGS (0 compilation warnings)
- ✅ NO DIALYZER ERRORS (clean dialyzer run)
- ✅ NO CREDO WARNINGS (clean credo run)
- ✅ COMMIT WORK

Then immediately proceed to next phase.

## 6-PHASE RECOVERY PLAN

### PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE STABILIZATION
Fix test failures and warnings to achieve stability baseline.

### PHASE 2: COMPLETE CORE IMPLEMENTATION  
Complete Foundation infrastructure and JidoSystem robustness.

### PHASE 3: MABEAM COORDINATION ENHANCEMENT
Implement reliable multi-agent orchestration.

### PHASE 4: DISTRIBUTION READINESS
Prepare architecture for distributed deployment.

### PHASE 5: PRODUCTION HARDENING
Add security, compliance, monitoring, scaling.

### PHASE 6: FINAL CLEANUP & OPTIMIZATION
Final quality pass and optimization.

## SUCCESS DEFINITION
- Foundation JidoSystem is 100% functional
- All tests pass with zero failures
- Zero warnings or errors of any kind
- Production-ready multi-agent system
- Complete recovery from previous code loss

## EXECUTION STATUS
**CURRENT PHASE**: 1 of 6
**STATUS**: IN PROGRESS - 14 test failures remaining (down from 27)
**NEXT ACTION**: Continue fixing test failures and warnings
