# Sleep Slop Action Plan

This document outlines the plan to address and eliminate `Process.sleep` and `:timer.sleep` calls from the test suite. Each instance has been categorized to prioritize the refactoring effort.

**Categories:**

*   **Dummy Process:** `spawn(fn -> Process.sleep(:infinity) end)` or similar. These are used to create long-lived PIDs for testing registries, supervisors, etc. They are generally acceptable in tests and are the lowest priority to change.
*   **Flaky Test:** `Process.sleep(t)` or `:timer.sleep(t)` where `t` is a fixed integer. This is a code smell indicating a race condition. The test is waiting an arbitrary amount of time, hoping an asynchronous action has completed. **These are the highest priority to fix.** They must be replaced with deterministic methods like waiting for a specific message, polling a state-change function, or using telemetry events.
*   **Simulated Work:** `Process.sleep(variable)` or `:timer.sleep(variable)`. The sleep duration is dynamic. These are often legitimate uses in tests that simulate work, test timeouts, or check time-based features (rate limiters, circuit breakers). These should be reviewed but are lower priority than flaky tests.
*   **Commented Out:** The sleep call is commented out and currently inactive. These should be removed.
