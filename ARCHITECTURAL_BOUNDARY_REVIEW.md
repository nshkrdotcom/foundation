# Architectural Boundary Review

This document provides an initial review of the architectural boundaries within the `foundation` project, focusing on the `lib/foundation` and `lib/mabeam` directories. Clear architectural boundaries are crucial for maintainability, testability, and scalability, preventing tight coupling and facilitating independent development.

## 1. High-Level Observations

*   **`lib/foundation`**: Appears to be the core library, containing fundamental building blocks and services. It includes modules for processes, services, infrastructure components (like rate limiters, circuit breakers), and coordination primitives.
*   **`lib/mabeam`**: Seems to be a higher-level application or domain-specific library, potentially building upon `foundation`. It contains modules related to agents, economics, coordination, and communication.

## 2. Potential Areas of Concern and Coupling

Based on the module names and previous audit findings (e.g., `GenServer.call` usage), several areas suggest potential boundary issues or tight coupling:

*   **`mabeam`'s Reliance on `foundation`**: It's expected that `mabeam` would depend on `foundation`. The concern arises if `mabeam` reaches deeply into `foundation`'s internal implementations rather than interacting through well-defined public interfaces. This can lead to `mabeam` being brittle to changes in `foundation`.

*   **Centralized Registries/Managers**: Modules like `ProcessRegistry` (in `foundation`) and `AgentRegistry` (in `mabeam`) are critical. If these become central points of synchronous interaction (`GenServer.call`), they can become bottlenecks and create tight coupling across various parts of the system that rely on them.

*   **Cross-Domain Logic**: There might be instances where logic that conceptually belongs to `mabeam` (e.g., specific agent behaviors or economic calculations) is implemented within `foundation`, or vice-versa. This blurs boundaries and makes it harder to reason about responsibilities.

*   **Implicit Dependencies**: Beyond explicit module imports, there can be implicit dependencies through shared data structures, message formats, or global configurations. These are harder to detect but can lead to unexpected coupling.

## 3. Recommendations for Improving Architectural Boundaries

To establish and maintain clearer architectural boundaries, consider the following:

1.  **Define Clear Public APIs**: For each major component or "bounded context" (e.g., `Foundation.ProcessRegistry`, `Mabeam.Agent`), explicitly define its public API. All external interactions should go through this API, preventing direct access to internal implementation details.

2.  **Minimize Synchronous Communication Across Boundaries**: While `GenServer.call` is sometimes necessary, excessive use across architectural boundaries can lead to serialization and tight coupling. Favor asynchronous communication (`GenServer.cast`, events, message queues) where possible, especially for long-running operations or when immediate responses are not strictly required.

3.  **Use Callbacks and Behaviors**: For extensibility and reduced coupling, define Elixir behaviors (interfaces) that components must implement. This allows for dependency inversion, where higher-level modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

4.  **Strategic Use of Contexts**: Adopt the "Contexts" pattern (common in Elixir) to group related modules and define their public interfaces. This helps in organizing code and enforcing boundaries.

5.  **Dependency Analysis Tools**: Utilize tools (e.g., `mix xref`) to analyze module dependencies regularly. This can help visualize the dependency graph and identify unexpected or circular dependencies that indicate boundary violations.

6.  **Documentation of Boundaries**: Explicitly document the architectural boundaries, the responsibilities of each component, and how they are intended to interact. This serves as a guide for developers and helps maintain consistency.

By proactively addressing these points, the project can achieve a more modular, resilient, and maintainable architecture. This will also make it easier to introduce new features, refactor existing components, and scale the system effectively.
