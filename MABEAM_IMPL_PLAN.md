## Updated Implementation Strategy

### Prerequisites Satisfied

All foundational components now support:
- âœ… Enhanced service lifecycle management
- âœ… Distributed coordination primitives
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling with MABEAM-specific types
- âœ… Health monitoring and dependency management
- âœ… CMMI Level 4 compliance features

### Phase 1 Updates (Foundation.MABEAM.Core)

**Enhanced Step 1.1: Type Definitions**
- Extend `Foundation.MABEAM.Types` to use enhanced error types
- Integrate with coordination primitives for variable types
- Add service behavior integration for orchestrator lifecycle

**Enhanced Step 1.2: Core Orchestrator**
- Use `Foundation.Services.ServiceBehaviour` as base behavior
- Integrate with coordination primitives for distributed orchestration
- Implement enhanced health checking and dependency management

**New Dependencies**:
```elixir
defmodule Foundation.MABEAM.Core do
  use Foundation.Services.ServiceBehaviour
  
  alias Foundation.{Coordination.Primitives, Types.EnhancedError}
  
  @impl true
  def service_config do
    %{
      health_check_interval: 15_000,
      dependencies: [:config_server, :event_store, :telemetry_service, :coordination_primitives],
      telemetry_enabled: true,
      resource_monitoring: true
    }
  end
  
  @impl true
  def handle_health_check(state) do
    # MABEAM-specific health checking
    case check_orchestration_health(state) do
      :ok -> {:ok, :healthy, state}
      {:degraded, reason} -> {:ok, :degraded, state}
      {:error, reason} -> {:error, reason, state}
    end
  end
end
```

### Phase 2 Updates (Foundation.MABEAM.AgentRegistry)

**Enhanced Integration**:
- Use enhanced error types for agent lifecycle errors
- Integrate with coordination primitives for distributed agent management
- Implement service behavior pattern for registry lifecycle

### Quality Gates Enhancement

**Updated Quality Gate Commands**:
```bash
# 1. Format all code
mix format

# 2. Compile with warnings as errors
mix compile --warnings-as-errors

# 3. Run enhanced dialyzer with MABEAM types
mix dialyzer --no-check --plt-add-deps

# 4. Run strict credo analysis
mix credo --strict

# 5. Run all tests including integration tests
mix test

# 6. Check test coverage (minimum 95%)
mix test --cover

# 7. Verify service health (new)
mix foundation.health_check

# 8. Validate service dependencies (new)
mix foundation.deps_check
```
